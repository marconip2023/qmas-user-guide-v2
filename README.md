# QMAS User Guide

Published guide: <https://marconip2023.github.io/qmas-user-guide-v2/>

The pages, screenshots, Markdown, and PDFs are files in this repository and are served from that site.

This copy comes from `marconip2023/guidline` commit `7aca94961069dd8e3e370c224db2197a0c476df2` (`cursor/qmas-user-guide-v2-9995`).

The header uses `assets/brand/qmas-logo.png`, a byte copy of `logo.png` from the root of `marconip2023/guidline` (60×24, added 2026-03-25 in `48b1f77`). It is the QMAS mark with the check through the M, the same mark in the reviewed screenshots. No license is stated in the repository. It is not a generated wordmark and it is not a WBA or ICW logo. No higher-resolution official file was available, so the header keeps the native pixels.

Page color comes from those same screenshots and the existing stylesheet: sidebar navy `#184dad`, white cards, page background `#f7faff`, and the blues already in `assets/site.css`. The typeface is the stylesheet’s Liberation Sans / Noto Sans. There is no QMAS Figma file in this repository, so this is brand alignment with those assets, not a claim of design-system compliance.

Each module has a Source and verification note. Factory Audit and the standalone Test Plan are source-only and not dev-verified. Product Testing and QC Inspection are mixed because the later quote or accept flow is older Help Center wording. The other modules are current UI where a reviewed screenshot backs the step. Help Center article links are the ones already cited in this guide. The Help Center home is https://icw-io.notion.site/QMAS-Help-Center-5cd9414da2474d16a7c405a3542fe4af.

The same `content/modules/*.json` files generate:

- the website (`index.html` and one folder per module)
- per-module Markdown and one combined Markdown file
- per-module PDFs and one combined PDF

## What is included

Fourteen modules. Twelve keep the published pages and 98 screenshot slots. Factory Audit and Test Plan are extra Help Center pages with no screenshots.

Help Center additions from 2026-11-13 are appended. They are marked source-documented, dev-verified, or gap. They do not replace earlier steps, captions, or reviewed images.

Reviewed inventory screenshots, 56 of 98. Forty-two slots are still pending. Six supplementary images are not part of the 98: one Factory validation image, three QC views, and two empty profile Certificate tabs. Those Certificate tabs are not the create-certification wizard. The newest files are 1280×800 desktop captures cropped to 1280×714. They are not high-resolution. Matching 1920 files were 1.5× upscales and were not used. Earlier reviewed files were not replaced. No records were written for the profile shots.

Reviewed replacement screenshots, 45 inventory files:

- Product Testing: all 9 published slots, including the refined order-details image
- Getting started: all 3 slots
- Product Management: 10 of 11 slots
- Product Profile: 11 slots from the first reviewed batch (Document, Shipping Detail, empty Compliance Data, the in-progress Test Data form, the empty Certificate Data form, and part of Quality Requirement)
- Document Management: list only
- Supplier Management: list, company overview, contact, and the Next validation state
- Factory Management: list, overview, scale, and contact
- Document Review: list, default Create Job form, and default Create Job for Supplier form
- QC Inspection: list and the Looking-to screen (Get QC inspection quote via ICW selected)
- Internal QC Inspection: list, Start internal inspection selected, and the blank step 1 requirement form
- AI Insight path: AI Risk Screening list and the blank New AI Risk Screening pop-up
- eFiling: list and the blank Add Documents for AI Extract dialog

Supplementary, not one of the 98: `factory-management/required-validation.jpg` shows required Contact person, email type, and email address after **Next**, not Submit.

These slots were not captured. Each stays an explicit placeholder and is not a picture of the missing state:

- `product-management/img/08-product-added.jpg` — needs a real product create
- `product-profile/img/08-test-data-filled.jpg` and `09-test-data-saved.jpg` — need a real saved Test Data record
- `product-profile/img/22-requirement-list.jpg` — needs a real Apply Template

Every other slot keeps the written step and shows **Image pending privacy review**. Published screenshot files are not copied, embedded, or linked.

The Product Profile captions follow the reviewed captures: Shipping Detail is 0.00 / N/A, Compliance Data is the empty state, the Test Data shot is an in-progress form (Export Market Africa and + Add '[UAT TEST]'), Quality Requirement shows one redacted row rather than an empty tab, and Add Requirement has Type and Name empty with Mandatory checked. Later profile shots are still to come.

## Dev-verified text updates (9 Nov 2026)

These are the only instruction changes. They were confirmed on `qmas-dev.icw.io` while the replacement screenshots were captured. Broader planning notes are not written into the guide.

- Settings opens from the account avatar. The menu includes Logout. The old “gear icon” wording is removed, including the eFiling FAQ that pointed at it.
- Home shows TicMate’s five workflow shortcuts in the order on the dev screen: AI Assessment, AI Insight, CPSC eFiling, Product Testing, Document Review.
- The Product Management list documents the verified filters: Product Category, Customer Product Category, Product Number, Status, Created By, Team, sort, and Reset. The reviewed list screenshot has those filters and no data rows.
- The supplier card body in `05-supplier-shipping.jpg` is intentionally blank.
- The product profile left menu includes QR Code. The Document tab also has Sort and Reset. This copy does not add a QR Code procedure.
- Related Product shows Unlink on the reviewed screenshot, so the create-product step names that control.
- Factory (optional) and Additional Info were already in the published create-product steps and match the dev screenshot.
- Product Profile wording next to the first reviewed batch matches those captures. It does not treat the empty Compliance Data tab as a saved table, and it does not say data was removed.

Attention and Business Overview stay in the Home steps. The reviewed Home crop shows the workflow shortcuts, not those sections.

## Build and check

From this folder:

```bash
python3 scripts/import_published_source.py --source /path/to/qmas-user-guide --images /path/to/reviewed-root
python3 scripts/build.py
python3 -m unittest tests/test_exports.py
python3 scripts/validate.py
```

`import_published_source.py` reads published text only. It never copies screenshot files from the source tree. Re-running it reapplies the dev-verified edits. `--images` must be a folder of `<module>/img/<file>.jpg` reviewed replacements.

`build.py` writes the site, `export/markdown/`, `export/print/`, and `export/pdf/`. Use `--skip-pdf` to rebuild text only.

`validate.py` extracts PDF text with `pdftotext`, counts embedded images with `pdfimages`, and checks that rendered page edges are not clipped. It needs `google-chrome`, `poppler-utils`, and `pillow`.

Open the site from this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.

## Layout

- `content/modules/` — canonical guide text
- `content/published-text-blocks.json` — text extracted from the published pages, used by tests
- `content/reviewed-images.json` — sha256 allowlist for replacement screenshots
- `assets/reviewed/` — the only screenshot files in this guide
- `assets/site.css` — page and print styles, inlined by the build
- `export/markdown/` — per-module and combined Markdown, with reviewed images under `images/`
- `export/pdf/` — per-module and combined PDFs
