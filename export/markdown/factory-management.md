Do not mark this whole module unverified. Source: QMAS Help Center — Manage your QMAS Factory Compliance Profile, last edited 2026-01-16 16:11:21 HKT. The article was not marked Updated November 2026.

Add a factory profile with its location, scale, equipment and certificates, so you can link it to suppliers, products and inspections.

- **Module:** Supplier / Factory Management
- **Start here:** https://qmas.icw.io/supplier-manager/suppliers → **Factory** tab → **Create Factory**
- **Direct link:** https://qmas.icw.io/supplier-manager/factory/create

## Overview

1. Open **Supplier / Factory Management**, click the **Factory** tab, then **Create Factory**.
2. **Factory Profile**: overview, scale, equipment and contact.
3. **Classification** (optional): product category and tags.
4. **Certification** (optional): add audit reports or certificates, then click **Done**.
5. The factory profile opens.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open the Factory tab

In the left menu, open **Supplier / Factory Management** and click the **Factory** tab. It lists your factories with location, status and audit certificates.

Click **Create Factory**, or **Import Factory** to add many factories from a file.

### 3. Factory Profile — scale and equipment (optional)

**Factory Scale**: outsource production, total employees, number of workers, factory size (square meters) and annual volume.

The equipment section lists machines and **Automation Production Line** entries: machine name, brand and model no., quantity and monthly production volume. Click **Add** for more rows.

![2. Factory Scale (optional).](images/factory-management/03-step1-scale.jpg)


*2. Factory Scale (optional).*

Scrolled view. Factory Scale is fully visible. Lower Factory Overview fields are blank placeholders, and a sliver of 3. Factory Capacity is also in frame.


### 4. Factory Profile — contact

Under **4. Contact**, fill in the **Contact person** and an **Email address** with its type (Company, QA, Sales or Other). **Contact no.** is optional. Click **Next**.

![Contact section and Next.](images/factory-management/04-step1-contact.jpg)


*Contact section and Next.*

Scrolled view. 3. Factory Capacity is blank and visible above 4. Contact and Next.

If Contact person or the email type and address are empty, **Next** (not Submit) marks them required. The fields stay on example placeholders.

*Step 3 Certification.*


### 7. Done — factory profile

QMAS shows “Create factory successfully!” and opens the factory profile. Use the tabs **Overview**, **Supplier**, **Certificate**, **Document** and **Compliance Data** to manage what is linked to this factory.

The reviewed screenshot is a readonly Overview of an existing profile. Product Category, Tag, Factory Capacity and Factory Scale are empty. It is not the Add Certification pop-up, and no record was written for this shot.

![Factory profile — Overview tab.](images/factory-management/08-factory-profile.jpg)


*Factory profile — Overview tab.*

Readonly Overview. Category, Tag, Capacity and Scale are empty. Created and Modified dates stay visible. This is a 1280×800 desktop crop (1280×714), not a high-resolution screenshot.

![Factory profile — Certificate tab, empty (No Data).](images/factory-management/supplemental-profile-certificate.jpg)


*Factory profile — Certificate tab, empty (No Data).*

Supplementary screenshot, not one of the 98 inventory slots. Genuine empty Certificate tab on the same profile. This is not Step 3 Certification or the Add Certification pop-up. No record was created or changed.

## Help Center additions and remaining gaps

This section adds Help Center material and named gaps. It does not replace the steps above.

- **Source-documented** — written in the original Help Center. The last-edited date is given. That does not by itself prove the current QMAS UI.
- **Dev-verified** — confirmed on qmas-dev.icw.io during guide work.
- **Gap** — named as missing or too thin. Not current behaviour until checked on dev.

Reviewed screenshots remain 56 of 98. Forty-two inventory slots are still pending. Six supplementary images are not part of the 98. Unreviewed screenshots were not copied.

### Source-documented — edit, documents, and import (last edited 2026-01-16)

Source: Manage your QMAS Factory Compliance Profile, https://app.notion.com/p/2ea9c62c39fc80198eddc3c9e7d20007. Not marked “Updated November 2026”. Labels need a dev check.

Edit company and contact information with the icon next to each section. Edit categories and tags with the pen icon.

**Add rating** uses the same four dimensions as suppliers in the Help Center (Responsiveness, Quality, Pricing, Market Awareness). Confirm whether a factory rating still exists and still uses these labels.

**Internal notes.** Add missed certificates or documents later in the **CERTIFICATE** and **DOCUMENT** sections.

The Help Center text has typographical errors (“thisfactory”, “factyory”). Those are not UI labels.

**Import Factory:** click **Import Factory**, then **Download here** for the factory template, fill it in (the article says create, update, and delete are supported), upload, and click **Next**. A toast confirms completion. One Help Center step title still says “Upload the filled **supplier** template”. Treat that as a source typo unless dev shows that exact wording.

Do not blanket-replace “supplier” wording on Factory screens. A filed bug asks for a context-by-context check.

### Remaining gaps

- Profile tabs Supplier, Certificate, Document, and Compliance Data are named, not walked through.
- Overview Product Category and Tag empty-state wording.
- List filters, Export, and the row toolbar.
- Screenshots for import, rating, notes, and tabs other than Overview.
