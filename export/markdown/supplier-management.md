# Supplier Management — Create a Supplier

## Source and verification

**Mixed.** The reviewed create path and the readonly Overview and empty Certificate tab are current UI verified. Edit, import, invite, and connection statuses are source-only and not dev-verified.

Add a supplier profile so you can link it to products, factories, documents and service jobs.

- **Module:** Supplier / Factory Management
- **Start here:** https://qmas.icw.io/supplier-manager/suppliers → **Create Supplier**
- **Direct link:** https://qmas.icw.io/supplier-manager/create
- **Steps:** 1 Supplier Profile → 2 Classification → 3 Certification → Done
- **Checked against:** QMAS dev, 4 Nov 2026

## Overview

1. Open **Supplier / Factory Management**, stay on the **Supplier** tab and click **Create Supplier**.
2. **Supplier Profile**: company overview and contact.
3. **Classification** (optional): product category and tags.
4. **Certification** (optional): add certificates, then click **Done**.
5. The supplier profile opens.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Open Supplier / Factory Management

In the left menu, open **Supplier / Factory Management**. The **Supplier** tab lists your suppliers with their location, category, status, connect status and rating.

Click **Create Supplier**. You can also use **Import Supplier** to add many suppliers from a file, or **Invite Supplier** to invite a supplier to connect with you on QMAS.

### 2. Supplier Profile — company overview

- **Upload Logo** (optional).

- **Supplier Name**: English name (required) and local-language name (optional).

### 3. Supplier Profile — contact

*Contact section.*

If a required field is empty when you click **Next**, it turns red, for example “Type is required” or “Email is required”. This screenshot also shows **English name is required**, **Location is required**, and **Contact person is required**. Next triggers the errors, not Submit. The fields still show empty or example placeholders, not a completed profile.

*The email type and email address are required.*

Also shows required errors on English name, Location, and Contact person. Triggered by Next, not Submit. Blank or example placeholders only.

*Step 3 Certification.*


### 6. Done — supplier profile

The supplier profile opens. Use the tabs **Overview**, **Product**, **Factory**, **Certificate**, **Document** and **Compliance Data** to manage everything linked to this supplier. Click the pencil icon next to the name, or next to **Contact**, to edit.

The reviewed screenshot is a readonly Overview of an existing profile. Product Category, Tag and Rating are empty. It is not the create-certification wizard, and no record was written for this shot.

![Supplier profile — Overview tab.](images/supplier-management/07-supplier-profile.jpg)


*Supplier profile — Overview tab.*

Readonly Overview. Category, Tag and Rating are empty. Created and Modified dates stay visible. This is a 1280×800 desktop crop (1280×714), not a high-resolution screenshot.

![Supplier profile — Certificate tab, empty (No Data).](images/supplier-management/supplemental-profile-certificate.jpg)


*Supplier profile — Certificate tab, empty (No Data).*

Supplementary screenshot, not one of the 98 inventory slots. Genuine empty Certificate tab on the same profile. This is not Step 3 Certification. No record was created or changed.

## Help Center additions and remaining gaps

This section adds Help Center material and named gaps. It does not replace the steps above.

- **Source-documented** — written in the original Help Center. The last-edited date is given. That does not by itself prove the current QMAS UI.
- **Dev-verified** — confirmed on qmas-dev.icw.io during guide work.
- **Gap** — named as missing or too thin. Not current behaviour until checked on dev.

Reviewed screenshots remain 56 of 98. Forty-two inventory slots are still pending. Six supplementary images are not part of the 98. Unreviewed screenshots were not copied.

### Source-documented — profile, import, and invite (last edited 2026-01-16)

Source: Manage your QMAS Supplier Compliance Profile, https://app.notion.com/p/aa532b63c9554db99b57676ee83d489c. It was not marked “Updated November 2026”. Labels need a dev check before they are published as current UI.

The 2024 setup guide is an older subset (no Import or Invite) and still says “top menu bar”. Prefer the create steps above, and the January 2026 article for the items below.

**Edit and add documents** (Help Center): edit company and contact information with the icon next to each section. Edit categories and tags with the pen icon. **Add rating** lists Responsiveness, Quality, Pricing, and Market Awareness. Add **Internal notes** for others in the company. Add missed certificates or documents later in the **CERTIFICATE** and **DOCUMENT** sections.

**Product and Factory linkage** (Help Center): related products use **+Product Linkage** (existing product list, or **New Product**). Related factories are under **FACTORY**, then **+Factory Linkage** (**Current Factory** or **New Factory**).

**Import Supplier** (Help Center): click **Import Supplier**, then **Download here** for the template, fill it in (the article says create, update, and delete are supported), upload, and click **Next**. A toast confirms completion.

Invite / connect a supplier “allows you to assign Document Review jobs to your connected suppliers.”

1. Click **Invite Supplier**.
2. Choose a supplier from the existing list, or invite a new supplier by entering their name.
3. Optionally enter a custom message for the invitation email.
4. Click **Invite**. The Help Center says an invitation email is sent to the supplier’s email address.
5. The supplier can accept via the invite link or, if they already have a QMAS account, via a pop-up the next time they log in.

Help Center connection statuses: **Invite** (invitation sent), **No Connection** (cannot interact via the platform), **Connected** (can be assigned Document Review jobs).

### Remaining gaps

- Current-UI confirmation of the labels above, especially linkage buttons and connection statuses.
- Screenshots for import, invite, ratings, notes, and tabs other than Overview.
- List filters, Export, and the row toolbar.
- Contact Email versus Email address, and Title Case. Filed bugs; re-check on dev. Do not invent the corrected labels.
